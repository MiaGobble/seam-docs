# Why use Seam?
Seam is three parts: states, animation, and component management.

Using states is a great way to solve many messy systems, especially frontend, because reactivity can be directly hooked into instances and components. You can use Seam to:
* Create source and reactive states to create a control flow for information
* Hook states directly to instances, which prevents you from manually needing to update instances
* Treat animation as states, resulting in an easy way to get things moving
* Create and use reusable components to simplify a codebase
* Explicitly define cause and effect, improving readability of code

Seam was originally built for UI and has since expanded to be for your entire game, both server and client. Seam states are simple and generic, meaning they can be used in many different places. Compared to other state libraries, Seam is much more feature-rich, flexible, and more performant.

## Assumptions made about you
All tutorials and examples assume the following:
* You are experienced with Luau enough to understand the nuances of syntax and more
* You know Roblox Studio

That being said, there is no expectation that you've ever tried a reactive state framework before, nor are you expected to be a top-tier expert in programming. Seam is easy to learn!
